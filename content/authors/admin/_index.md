Hi! My name is Edward Leung and I am currently a MASc student at the University of British Columbia. My main research interest is the application of silicon photonics for quantum computing, and I am currently under the supervision of Professor Lukas Chrostowski. I am also a part of the NSERC CREATE Quantum Computing Program.
