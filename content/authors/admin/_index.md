Hello and welcome! I'm Edward Leung, a MASc student at the University of British Columbia currently under the supervision of Professor Lukas Chrostowski.
<br/><br/>
My research focus currently revolves around the intersection of silicon photonics with quantum technologies. I am a participant of both the NSERC CREATE in Quantum Computing and the Mitacs Accelerate Program of which I am actively contributing to the project 'QuantumIO: Integrated photonics control and readout system for quantum computing'.
<br/><br/>
Thanks for visiting!
