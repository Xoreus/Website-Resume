      <description>Developed a C program using MCUXpresso for the LPC804 microcontroller, utilizing internal clocks and system interrupts to communicate with a 7-segment display, servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and push button. Communication between microcontroller and peripherals use protocols such as GPIO, PWM and internal timers such as System Tick, Multi-rate, and Self-Wake-up. Designed and created for an embedded systems course, received a final grade of A+.</description>
